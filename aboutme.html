        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Rebecca and I grew up in Seattle, Washington. I am currently attending BYU-Idaho and I am studying communication!
             I have been playing piano since I was 8 years old and I love it! When I'm stressed or overwhelmed, music is my favorite outlet. 
             I find peace through focusing on the notes and the way they sound together. Playing the piano helps me clear my head when I'm overthinking, 
             and it helps me to remember that life can have moments where everything slows down and peace replaces chaos.
        </p>
